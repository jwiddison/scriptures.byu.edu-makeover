In my office work as an executive, I had assistants and secretaries who kindly helped me with the tasks.</p>

I have an email address, a Twitter account, and a Facebook page. I own a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, and a digital camera. And, while my tech skills may not quite measure up to those of a typical seven-year-old, for a septuagenarian, I do all right.</p>

Sending a message and getting a reply could take days or even months. Today our messages travel thousands of miles into the sky or thousands of meters beneath the oceans to reach someone on the other side of the world, and if there is a delay of even a few seconds, we get frustrated and impatient.</p>

                    	<h2>Do We Take Spiritual Truths for Granted?</h2>
                    	<p uri="/ensign/2016/11/saturday-morning-session/o-how-great-the-plan-of-our-god.p21" class="" id="p21">Taking for granted our modern technologies and conveniences may be a relatively small matter. But, sadly, we sometimes take a similar attitude toward the eternal and soul-expanding doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the Church of Jesus Christ, we have been given so much. We are surrounded by such an astonishing wealth of light and truth that I wonder if we truly appreciate what we have.</p>
                    	<p uri="/ensign/2016/11/saturday-morning-session/o-how-great-the-plan-of-our-god.p22" class="" id="p22">Think of those early disciples who walked and talked with the Savior during His earthly ministry. Imagine the thanksgiving and reverence that must have flooded their hearts and filled their minds when they saw Him risen from the tomb, when they felt the wounds in His hands. Their lives would never be the same!</p>
                    	<p uri="/ensign/2016/11/saturday-morning-session/o-how-great-the-plan-of-our-god.p23" class="" id="p23">Think of the early Saints of this dispensation who knew the Prophet Joseph Smith and heard him preach the restored gospel. Imagine how they must have felt to know that the veil between heaven and earth had parted again, shedding light and knowledge upon the world from our celestial home above.</p>
                    	<p uri="/ensign/2016/11/saturday-morning-session/o-how-great-the-plan-of-our-god.p24" class="" id="p24">But most of all, think of how you felt when for the first time you believed and understood that you are truly a child of God; that Jesus Christ willingly suffered for <span class="emphasis">your</span> sins so that you may be clean again; that priesthood power is real and can bind you to your loved ones for time and for all eternity; that there is a living prophet on the earth today. Isn’t that wonderful and amazing?</p>
                    	<p uri="/ensign/2016/11/saturday-morning-session/o-how-great-the-plan-of-our-god.p25" class="" id="p25">Considering all of this, how could it ever be possible that we of all people would not be excited about attending our Church worship services? Or get tired of reading the holy scriptures? I suppose this could be possible&nbsp;only if our hearts were <span class="emphasis">past feeling</span> to experience gratitude and awe for the sacred and sublime gifts God has granted us. Life-changing truths are before our eyes and at our fingertips, but sometimes we sleepwalk on the path of discipleship. Too often we let ourselves be distracted by the imperfections of our fellow members instead of following the example of our Master. We tread a path covered with diamonds, but we can scarcely distinguish them from ordinary pebbles.</p>

Often I would start to explain the differences, like the Word of Wisdom. Other times I would emphasize the similarities with other Christian religions. None of this would impress them very much. But when I talked about the great plan of happiness our Father in Heaven has for us as His children, I had their attention.</p>

I made circles that represented premortal life, mortality, and the return to our Heavenly Parents after this life.</p>

When I explained these principles in my own simple words, my heart would overflow with gratitude for a God who loves His children and a Savior who redeemed all of us from death and hell. I was so proud of this message of love, joy, and hope.</p>

It was as if they had always known these things to be true, as if I was simply casting light on something that was always and deeply rooted in their hearts.</p>

We knew that if we gave our heart to Him, trusted Him, and strived with all the energy of our soul to walk in the path of discipleship, we could be washed clean and once again enter the presence of our beloved Father in Heaven.</p>
